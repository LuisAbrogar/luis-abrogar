Using the Google Maps API, it tracks the live route the user is taking until the ride is completed. Google Firebase real-time database is used to store the ride statistics such as average speed and total distance, which can be viewed in the user’s ride history.</p>

The instruction buffer has an instruction input and a control signal which allows the input to be stored. The register file holds 32 registers and is capable of 3 reads and 1 write in each cycle. The forwarding unit ensures the most recent register value is used and the ALU takes 3 register inputs and an instruction input, calculating based on the specified instruction and sending the result to the specified register.</p>
